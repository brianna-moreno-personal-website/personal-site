    <p>Hi! Im Bri, i'm a 20 year old student working towards a fullfilling future in web development.
        I am currently studying at Fullstack Academy. 
        I started class in Februrary 2023 and am expected to graduate in October 2023.
        I currently work at Amazon as a stocker but am hoping to move on once I get my certificate.

         Out of high school I originally wanted to go into a career around graphic design but
         I was never fully confident in it. While I was studying graphic design one of my teachers had brought up web development in the list of future career routes
         and it immediately grabbed my attention.
         I've always loved anything computers, and looking at code has always interested me as much as it scared me, so when
         amazon had the opportunity to take the class I knew I couldnt pass it up!!
    
        </p>
    <p>
        Outside of work I love to create art, learn video game development, travel, and spend time with my boyfriend and our two cats.
